  COMPREHEND: "Comprehend is divided into two subservices: Comprehend and Comprehend Medical." +
  "\nComprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service " +
  "that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. " +
  "Provided any given text, Comprehend can be used to extract information from unstructured text " +
  "about general insights or relationships, and provide data about expected relations with a specific certainty. " +
  "\nComprehend Medical is a natural language processing service that makes it easy to " +
  "extract relevant medical information from unstructured text. Using " +
  "Comprehend Medical, you can quickly and accurately gather information, such as medical " +
  "condition, medication, dosage, strength, and frequency from a variety of sources like " +
  "doctorsâ€™ notes, clinical trial reports, and patient health records.",

  FORECAST: "Forecast is used to produce future business outcomes including product demand, " +
  "resources needed, or financial performance. By providing time series data, Forecast will predict the future " +
  "requirements or expectations based on past performance.",

  LEX: "Lex is used for building conversational interfaces for any application relying on voice or text. " +
  "Lex provides automatic speech recognition (ASR) with natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize text and " +
  "and enable engaging user experiences with lifelike conversation.",

  PERSONALIZE: "Personalize is used to create individualized recommendations for customers using any applications. " +
  "This service allows developers with no prior machine learning (ML) experience to create easily sophisticated " +
  "personalization capabilities within their applications. Based on provided criteria, including clicks, page view, " +
  "and more, Personalize will process and examine this data to identify what is meaningful to the custom, and return " +
  "customized recommendations. You can also add additional information relating to the customer, including age, " +
  "ethnicity, or geogrpahic location to further personalize the recommendations.",

  POLLY: "Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that relies on advanced deep learning " +
  "technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Select from dozens of languages " +
  "and male or female voices to cater to your audience. Neural TTS technology also supports a Newcaster " +
  "reading style tailored to news narration use cases",

  REKOGNITION: "Rekognition is divided into two subservices: Image Rekognition and Video Rekognition. " +
  "Both services are used to rekognize objects, people, text, scenes, activities, and more. " +
  "Image Rekognition provides a variety of processing techniques: object and scene detection, image moderation, " +
  "facial analysis, celebrity recognition, face comparisons, and understanding text in images" +
  "Video Rekognition processes videos through video analysis to discover any recognizable attributes in the provided video",

  TEXTRACT: "Textract allows quick and easy text extraction from documents and forms. Textract will automatically " +
  "detect a document's layout, understand data relationships in forms and tables, and maintain context. This allows " +
  "any extracted data to be easily usable in applications or stored in databases without complicated processing " +
  "by developers.",

  TRANSCRIBE: "Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service, making it easier for developers to add " +
  "speech to text capabilities. This can be used for creating transcriptions of customer service calls, providing " +
  "subtitles on audio or video content, or creating text from WAV or MP3 file formats with timestamps with every " +
  "identified word in the audio.",

  TRANSLATE: "Translate is a neural machine translation service, using deep learning models to deliver accurate " +
  "and natural sounding translation compared to traditional statistical and rule-based translation algorithms. " +
  "Translate allows products to localize content, translating websites and applications for international users. ",
